# Keylogger Python Script

## What is a keylogger?
Also known as a keystroke logger, a keylogger is a monitoring software tool designed to record each key pressed on a computer system. There are several types that exist and can be used for malicious activity. 

## Usage
This python code is a barebones script that will simply print out YOUR keystrokes onto YOUR terminal/text file when executed in the text editor. 

## Statement of Intent

This keylogger project was undertaken solely for educational and research purposes to deepen my understanding of cybersecurity concepts, particularly around potential threats and system vulnerabilities. The project was designed in a controlled environment with explicit permission and safeguards to prevent any misuse.

I do not condone or support the use of keyloggers or similar tools for malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information, invading privacy, or violating any laws. 
Ethical conduct is a cornerstone of my approach to technology, and I strongly advocate for using cybersecurity knowledge responsibly to protect systems and individuals from harm.
