Below are the step by step instructions on how you can set up an Active Directory domain, a domain host, an a user as an example. Some of these instructions are derived off of Microsoft's Active Directory Guided Project, hence the similar naming convention. 

However, there are key differences, including the fact that Microsoft's project requires the use of Hyper-V (which I don't have since I only have Windows Home Edition).

Software you will need:

1. Oracle VirtualBox                   [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. WWindows 2022 Server Edition ISO    [Windows 2022 Server Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-server-2022)
3. WIndows 10 ISO                      [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)
